## Aim {#aim}

Provide attendees enough information of Fukaya category and derived category of coherent sheaves to understand the main statement of homological mirror symmetry.
\\[{\rm Fuk}(X) \cong D^{b}{\rm Coh}(X^{\vee})\\]
Also, I hope this learning seminar will give us a good chance to communicate with others in Tsinghua University, so feel free to invite others!


## Time and Place {#time-and-place}

2022.2-2022.6

More specific time and place **to be determined**. Maybe in Jinchunyuan West Building.


## Syllabus {#syllabus}

Currently, there are two speakers, Lan Zhuoming will talk about Fukaya category and Zhang Nantao will talk about derived category of coherent sheaves. Everyone is welcomed to give a talk on either the topics or other aspects of homological mirror symmetry.

1.  Derived category of coherent sheaves
2.  Fukaya category
3.  Homological mirror symmetry for elliptic curve
