## Aim {#aim}

Provide attendees enough information of Fukaya category and derived category of coherent sheaves to understand the main statement of homological mirror symmetry.
\\[D^{b}{\rm Fuk}(X) \cong D^{b}{\rm Coh}(X^{\vee})\\]
Also, I hope this learning seminar will give us a good chance to communicate with others in Tsinghua University, so feel free to invite others!


## Time and Place {#time-and-place}

2022.2-2022.6

More specific time and place **to be determined**. Maybe in Jinchunyuan West Building.


## Prerequisite {#prerequisite}

Some basic knowledge about differential geometry, homological algebra and category theory is required. For algebraic geometry, we assume everybody knows at least the definition of scheme and coherent sheaf. Hartshorne chapter 2 and 3 is the standard reference. Professor Sun Shenghao(孙晟昊) will teach algebraic geometry next semester but mainly about algebraic varieties (For example, Hartshorne 1). So you have to learn the language of schemes by yourself either in winter vacation or during the algebraic geometry course. Knowing algebraic topology and complex geometry will be helpful.


## Syllabus {#syllabus}

Currently, there are three speakers, Su Weilin(苏蔚琳) will talk about part 1, Lan Zhuoming will talk about 3 and Zhang Nantao will talk about 2,4,5. Everyone is welcomed to give a talk on either the topics or other aspects of homological mirror symmetry.

1.  History of homological mirror symmetry
2.  Derived category
3.  Fukaya category
4.  Derived category of coherent sheaves
5.  Homological mirror symmetry for elliptic curve

We choose this order because the history serves as the introduction and backgroud of the topic. The derived category is a natural sucessor of the course "Commutative algebra and homological algebra". In case somebody doesn't know much about algebraic geometry, we tend to put the derived category of coherent sheaves later and deal with symplectic geometry side first. You can know more about algebraic geometry from the course taught by Professor Sun Shenghao. As an example, we will prove the homological mirror symmetry for elliptic curve at last.
