## Nantao Zhang (张南涛) {#nantao-zhang--张南涛}

Graduate Student of Mathematics, Tsinghua University

Supervised by [Will Donovan](https://w-donovan.github.io/)

Email: znt21 (at) mails.tsinghua.edu.cn


## Research Interset {#research-interset}

My research interest lies in enumerative geometry and mathematical physics, especially Donaldson-Thomas theory and Bridgeland stability. I am also interested in derived algebraic geometry and mirror symmetry. See [more](./post/questions_of_interest).


## Activities {#activities}

I'm currently organizing two seminars:

-   Algebraic Geometry Seminar, Topic: Intersection Theory ([Website](./post/algebraic_geometry_seminar_2022_fall/))
-   Enumerative Geometry Seminar ([Website](https://yau-msc-events.github.io/seminars.html)), joint with Will Donovan, Hao Zhang(张昊)

Past Seminar:

-   Enumerative Geometry Learning Seminar at Tsinghua, 2022.2-2022.6, joint with Lan Zhuoming (兰倬铭), Topic: Homological Mirror Symmetry: Fukaya Category and Derived Category of Coherent Sheaves ([Website](./post/enumerative_geometry_seminar_2022/))

I'm willing to learn [more]({{< relref "questions_of_interest#i-want-to-learn-dot-dot-dot" >}}).


## Teaching {#teaching}

-   2021.9-2022.1, Teaching assistant, Linear Algebra 1
-   2022.3-2022.6, Teaching assistant, Advanced Linear Algebra
-   2022.9-2023.1, Teaching assistant, Geometry and Symmetry


## Other Interest {#other-interest}

Apart from mathematics, I am a fan of Marxism, philosophy (Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Nietzsche, Foucault and language philosophy) and literature (the Chinese poems and modern novels). I also like Vocaloid, [白石溪](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ws411X7BJ) is one of my favourite songs.

I am also an open source amateur and have some experience in programming. My personal Linux configuration can be found at [My tools](./post/my_tools) and [After installation of Ubuntu](./post/ubuntu). My emacs configuration can be found at [Emacs](./post/emacs_configuration), [Emacs mu4e configuration](./post/mu4e). The complete code of my emacs configuration can be found at <https://github.com/zenith-john/zenith-emacs>. A toy QT program and python script can be found in my github repositories.


## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

-   I use Zenith John as Nickname, because of similar spelling of ZeNiTh and Zhang NanTao, and similar pronunciation of Zhang(张) in Chinese and John in English.
-   I was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.
-   The picture on the home page is from the [slides](http://www.math.columbia.edu/%7Eokounkov/icm.pdf) of Andrei Okounkov on ICM 2018.
-   The photo was taken at 2021.6 before old Tsinghua library.
