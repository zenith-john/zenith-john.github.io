## Research Interest {#research-interest}

My research interest lies in enumerative geometry and mathematical physics, especially about Donaldson-Thomas type invariants. These invariants are at the interface of many areas, including mirror symmetry, integrable system, geometric Langlands, Bridgeland stability, low-dimensional topology and supersymmetric gauge theory. Occasionally, I think about transporting geometric ideas to number theory via (enhanced) [Weil's Rosetta stone](http://www.ams.org/notices/200503/fea-weil.pdf). Some of the ideas are summarized in the following diagram. For details, see [here](./post/questions_of_interest).

## Other Interest {#other-interest}

Apart from mathematics, I am a fan of Marxism, philosophy (Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Nietzsche, Foucault and the philosophy of language) and literature (the Chinese poems and modern novels). I also like Vocaloid, [白石溪](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ws411X7BJ) is one of my favorite songs.

I am also an open source amateur and have some experience in programming. My personal Linux configuration can be found at [My tools](./post/my_tools) and [After installation of Ubuntu](./post/ubuntu). My emacs configuration can be found at [Emacs](./post/emacs_configuration), [Emacs mu4e configuration](./post/mu4e). The complete code of my emacs configuration can be found at <https://github.com/zenith-john/zenith-emacs>. A toy QT program and python script can be found in my github repositories.


## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

-   I use Zenith John as Nickname, because of similar spelling of ZeNiTh and Zhang NanTao, and similar pronunciation of Zhang(张) in Chinese and John in English.
-   I was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.
-   The picture on the home page is from the [slides](http://www.math.columbia.edu/%7Eokounkov/icm.pdf) of Andrei Okounkov on ICM 2018.
-   The photo was taken at 2021.6 before old Tsinghua library.
