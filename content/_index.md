## Research Interest {#research-interest}

My research interest lies in algebraic geometry and mathematical physics around derived category of coherent sheaves, including (homological) mirror symmetry, Donaldson-Thomas type invariants, Bridgeland stability, Hodge theory and quantum cohomology.

Currently, I'm interested in Bridgeland stability and semiorthogonal decomposition.


## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

-   I use Zenith John as Nickname, because of similar spelling of ZeNiTh and Zhang NanTao, and similar pronunciation of Zhang(张) in Chinese and John in English.
-   I was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.
-   The picture on the home page is from the [slides](http://www.math.columbia.edu/%7Eokounkov/icm.pdf) of Andrei Okounkov on ICM 2018.
-   The photo was taken at 2021.06 before old Tsinghua library.
