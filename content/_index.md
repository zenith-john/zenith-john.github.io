## Current and Future Activities {#current-and-future-activities}

Not this semester.


## Research Interest {#research-interest}

My research interest lies in enumerative geometry and mathematical physics, especially about Donaldson-Thomas type invariants. These invariants are at the interface of many areas, including mirror symmetry, integrable system, geometric Langlands, Bridgeland stability, low-dimensional topology and supersymmetric gauge theory. Some of the ideas are summarized in the following diagram. For details, see [here](./post/questions_of_interest).

## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

-   I use Zenith John as Nickname, because of similar spelling of ZeNiTh and Zhang NanTao, and similar pronunciation of Zhang(张) in Chinese and John in English.
-   I was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China.
-   The picture on the home page is from the [slides](http://www.math.columbia.edu/%7Eokounkov/icm.pdf) of Andrei Okounkov on ICM 2018.
-   The photo was taken at 2021.6 before old Tsinghua library.
