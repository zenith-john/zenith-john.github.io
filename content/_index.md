# About Me
My name is Zhang Nantao(张南涛), born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China. I am current a graduate student at Tsinghua University. 

# Education
- 2021.9-now, PhD student, Mathematics, Tsinghua University, Advisor: [Will Donovan](https://w-donovan.github.io/)
- 2017.9-2021.6, Bachelor, Biology, Tsinghua University, Advisor: [Yinqing Li](http://web.mit.edu/yinqingl/www/)

# Research Interset
My research focuses on **enumerative geometry**, mainly **Donaldson-Thomas theory** and related topics, including Hall algebra, Bridgeland stability space for Calabi-Yau 3-fold, MNOP conjecture, special holonomy, and BPS states. I am also interested in homological mirror symmetry, low dimensional topology, derived algebraic geometry, geometric Langlands, symplectic duality, and p-adic geometry.

# Teaching
2020.9-2021.1, Teaching assistant, Linear Algebra 1

# Activities
I'm currently organizing two seminars:
- Enumerative Geometry Learning Seminar at Tsinghua, 2021.2-2022.6, joint with Lan Zhuoming (兰倬铭), Topic: Homological Mirror Symmetry: Fukaya Category and Derived Category of Coherent Sheaves
- Enumerative Geometry Learning Seminar ([Website](https://yau-msc-events.github.io/seminars.html), joint with Hao Zhang(张昊), Topics: TBD

# Other Interest
Apart from mathematics, I am a fan of Marxism, philosophy (Confucius, Mencius, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Nietzsche, Foucault and language philosophy) and literature (the Chinese poems and modern novels). I also like Vocaloid, [白石溪](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ws411X7BJ) is one of my favourite songs.

I am also an open source amateur and have some experience in programming. My personal Linux configuration can be found at [My tools]({{< relref "my_tools">}}) and [After installation of Ubuntu]({{< relref "ubuntu">}})。My emacs configuration can be found at [Emacs]({{< relref "emacs_configuration">}})，[Emacs mu4e configuration]({{< relref "mu4e">}}). The complete code of my emacs configuration can be found at <https://github.com/zenith-john/zenith-emacs>. A toy QT program and python script can be found in my github repositories.

# Miscellaneous
- I use Zenith John as Nickname, because of similar spelling of ZeNiTh and Zhang NanTao, and similar pronunciation of Zhang(张) in Chinese and John in English.
